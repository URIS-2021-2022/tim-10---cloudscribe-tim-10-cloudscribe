Longitude is given as an angular measurement ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian to +180° eastward and −180° westward.

Latitude is an angle which ranges from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles. Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east–west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude
Equator has a latitude of 0°, the North Pole has a latitude of 90° North (written 90° N or +90°), and the South Pole has a latitude of 90° South (written 90° S or −90°)

For calculations, the West/East suffix is replaced by a negative sign in the western hemisphere.
