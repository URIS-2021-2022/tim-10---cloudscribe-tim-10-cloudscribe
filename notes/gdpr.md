Instead of a small text banner on the side that can easily be ignored or overlooked, implement a gated popup upon site visit that highlights the permissions that you seek, with a link to a detailed page for users to learn more. Before the user is able to interact with the site content, he or she would be required to take one of three possible actions on this gated popup:

Click “Accept”. This dismisses the popup, and constitutes consent for the controller.
Click “Visit settings to decline”. This dismisses the popup, and opens up a new window to a technical settings page for data subjects to decline or revoke previously granted consent.
Click “x” to dismiss the popup. This lets the user to access the web content, but does not in itself grant the controller consent. The website must wait for the user to click accept on a future site visit before processing his or her personal data.

3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
