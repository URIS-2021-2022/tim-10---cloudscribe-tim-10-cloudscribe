An attempt was made to register a new account at @Model.Tenant.SiteName

your existing account by logging in here: @Html.Raw(@Model.LoginUrl)

If you have forgotten your login details, then you can reset your password
here: @Html.Raw(@Model.ResetUrl)

@if (@Model.ConfirmUrl != null)

    @:You may still need to confirm your email address for your account to become
    @:active. Please check for any previous emails from this site that ask you to
    @:confirm your email address or use this link to confirm your email address now: 
    @Html.Raw(@Model.ConfirmUrl)
}

@if (@Model.StillNeedsApproval)
{
    @:An administrator still needs to approve the account associated with this email
    @:address. Please be patient.
