# Contributor Code of Conduct

As maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who
contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies only within project spaces and is not intended to impose a political philosophy on anyone or limit their ability to express themselves in other environments. 

You do not have to agree to this document in order to participate in this community, it is not a contract, we are only expressing the expected behavior within this project space. Basically we expect everyone to treat everyone else politely and with respect in project related interactions. If you feel that is too much to ask, you have the freedom also to not participate in this project. We don't need help bad enough to accept any mean or abusive behavior in this project.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting a project maintainer at abuse@cloudscribe.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances (not to be interpreted as heavy handed). Maintainers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
